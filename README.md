### 1x Bro vs. 2x PPL vs. 3x UL
- Winner 1x Bro

### Bro has better recovery:frequency for same session 
- Bro: 7x24 hour rest
- UL: 2x24 hour rest
- PPL: 3x24 hour rest

### Bro has better recovery:overlap
- Bro: High upper body overlap, but ligher pump sessions, less strain
- UL: No overlap but too frequent to recover and more strain
- PPL: Negligible overlap but still frequent so some strain

### Bro has better focus:overall stimulus/frequency
- Bro: Simple structure, simple tracking, single body part and intuitive due to bodily feedback, could increase focus, 
less context switching and cognitive overhead/complexity
- UL: Complex tracking and structure, broad body part coverage is demotivating, 
loses focus, context switching, and cognitive overhead/complexity
- PPL: Worser focus than UL due to movement based workout, different pattern of exercises and same cons as UL

### Bro has better consistency/enjoyment:optimal workout
- Bro: Disallows skipping a session, sessions are intentional and enjoyable, no swaying allowed
- UL: Complex intuitive tracking, lack of stimulus feedback (low pump/feel) is demotivating and confusing
- PPL: Same as UL

### Values:
- High recovery
- No joint or tendon pain
- Low soreness
- Better quality of life and stress management
- Prevent the need for deload by preventing overexercising/overreaching/overtraining
- As well as prevent overuse or injuries

### Achieved by:
- Fair technique, full ROM, pump out the reps, controlled but fine tempo 
- Low load/intensity
- Moderate volume
- Low frequency
- No failure, few reps in reserve
- Focus only on weight progressing over long timeframe
- Train like a pu$$y but overload weights systematically
- Fix sets and reps at 3x10
- No shy staying at same weights, and it will still grow
- No need to obsess over working sets, all sets are "working" count them for precise fatigue gauging
- No intensity techniques
- And no "99% people aren't training hard" can kiss bs

Session:
- 3x10 per exercise, includes all warmup (ramp up) and working sets 
- Do enough different exercises intuitively
- Focus on stretch, peak squeeze, pass, eccentric, TUT and lengthened partials
